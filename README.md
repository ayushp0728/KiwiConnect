This project was made to serve as a simple remote control for very basic macbook functions. 
To connect to your own devices, run this device and use your personal device IP rather than localhost or "IP" 
Run both the backend and frontend folders locally, and open the website on any of your other devices.

After a few permission requests that will pop up, you will have a very simple controller for brightness and volume.
